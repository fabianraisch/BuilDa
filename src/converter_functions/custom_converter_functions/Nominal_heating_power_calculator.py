    '''
    A class to calculate the nominal heating power required for a building based on 
    various parameters including building characteristics and environmental conditions.

    This class is designed to implement the calculation of nominal heating power as per 
    the guidelines established in DIN 18599-2. 
    It takes into account both the internal and external temperature settings, 
    as well as heat loss due to ventilation and building materials.
